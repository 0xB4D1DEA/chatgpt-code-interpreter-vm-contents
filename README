I spent an evening investigating the file structure and default file contents that exist on ChatGPT 4.0's Advanced Data Analysis plugin.

file_contents_outpul.txt is the raw exfil, and recreate_files_script.py parses it to recreate the file structure as it existed in the code interpreter's virtual machine. 

Enjoy
