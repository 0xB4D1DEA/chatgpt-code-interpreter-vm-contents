I spent an evening investigating the VM and dumped output files here.

Feel free to use it if interested in investigating the file structure and default file contents that exist on ChatGPT 4.0's Advanced Data Analysis plugin.

file_contents_outpul.txt is the raw exfil, and recreate_files_script.py parses it to recreate the file structure as it existed in the code interpreter's virtual machine.
